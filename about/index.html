      <p><em>A discussion group for thoughts and papers that interest us (and are too small for the IKE seminars).</em></p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Friday thoughts is a weekly discussion group where we discuss ongoing projects and project-ideas, and top papers in our field(s). The first part of meetings (30-45 minutes) is allocated for idea/project discussions, the remaining time for discussion of the paper of the week.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1 - project/idea discussion:</strong> One individual distributes a short piece of text (maximally 5 pages) with content or project ideas that they would like comments on. A primary and secondary discussant reads the text carefully and prepares comments and thoughts. At the meeting, the individual shortly presents the content/idea so that all participants can discuss. After the short presentation discussants and participants provide comments and thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2 - Top Papers:</strong> Each week we discuss one paper recently published in a top-journal (e.g. Research Policy, Quarterly Journal of Economics, and Regional Studies). The purpose of the discussion is to dissect ongoing research tendencies (what are the hot topics in our fields), research approaches (how do top researchers think about the topic), and approaches to writing well-published papers. The individual proposing the paper may specify a particular emphasis for the discussion.</p>
<p>After each meeting we will have friday cake/soda/beer to celebrate the success of the meeting and arrival of the weekend.</p>
<h3 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h3>

<p><strong>Signing up:</strong> Email <a href="mailto:sije@business.aau.dk">sije@business.aau.dk</a> who will add you to our email list.</p>
<p><strong>Information about meetings:</strong> We will maintain a shared OneDrive folder which contains information for each meeting, including links to papers. Each week (two days before meetings) we will send an email reminder with content for part 1 and 2.</p>
<p><strong>Organizing Committee:</strong> Sigrid Jessen, Roman Jurowetzki, and Jesper Eriksen.</p>
<p><strong>Proposing content for discussion:</strong> Send an email to Sigrid with content and discussants (who have agreed to discuss the content). Each individual is assigned the next free week.</p>
<p>Proposing papers for discussion: Send the paper to Sigrid. 5 days prior to meetings we will make a poll if there's several contending papers for discussions.</p>
